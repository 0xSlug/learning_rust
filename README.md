# learning_rust
Prerequisite for beginning my C Compiler Repo.

Hello, world!  
I'm beginning a project to write a C compiler in Rust following No Starch Press' book.  I want to do it in Rust to learn a new systems-level language.  
This whole repo will be where I store the projects in ['The Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
